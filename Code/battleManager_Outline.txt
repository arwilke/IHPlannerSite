battleManager Outline

.bManager.contBattle() calls continueBattle()

continueBattle() checks for end conditions, and then calls the stepPhase function for the current phase if there aren't any end conditions

stepHeroPhase() calls stepActionStack().  If stepActionStack() returns false (meaning its empty), then adds a new action to the stack

stepActionStack() returns false if there are no actions, otherwise calls chooseTarget() if the action doesn't have targets
